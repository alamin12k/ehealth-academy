            <h3>St. Petersburg, Russia: Rococo</h3>
            <img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/593af2dc986db21b5a8a00de/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/architecture-cities-st-petersburg-GettyImages-450576251.jpg" alt="Rococo in St. Pertersburg" width="400px">
            <p class="description">The Rococo movement came about in the 18th century in France as a way to fight against the strict, symmetrical Baroque style that came before it. While both movements are known for their richly decorated architecture styles, Rococo has elements all of its own: think curves, pale colors, and secular, light-hearted themes. The style made its way across Europe, where it found favor with the female rulers in St. Petersburg. The Catherine Palace (commissioned by Catherine I and expanded by her daughter, Empress Elizabeth) is by far the most famous example in the area.</p>

            <h3>Budapest, Hungary: Art Nouveau</h3>
            <img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/593af2db9dad6e6fdceb8d8f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/architecture-cities-budapest-GettyImages-541412586.jpg" alt="Art Nouveau in Budapest" width="400">
            <p class="description">Art Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and the city remains one of the best places to see the architectural style today. One can find curving forms, organic shapes, use of iron and glass, and colorful flourishes all over this stretch of the Danube, including the Gresham Palace, Hotel Gellért and spas (pictured), Museum of Applied Arts, and Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.</p>

            <h3>Florence, Italy: Renaissance</h3>
            <img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/593af2e73cdcc01fd3147f64/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/architecture-cities-florence-GettyImages-493917575.jpg" alt="Renaissance in Florence" width="400">
            <p class="description">It's hard to escape Renaissance aesthetics in Florence, the birthplace of the late-14th-century movement. The era's embellished but symmetrical and geometrical structures—columns and domes—and emphasis on realism and the human form departed from the irregular and severe lines of the Medieval period. They're most visible at Florence's Duomo and Basilica of Santa Maria Novella.</p>

            <h3>Vestrahorn: Stokksnes peninsula, Iceland</h3>
            <img src="https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000162-f3a3-d0d5-a57f-fbf33c300000/3-vestrahorn-iceland.jpg?update-time=1677093911778&size=responsive970" alt="Stokksnes Penisula Ireland" width="400px">
            <p class="description">Nearly 1,500 feet tall, Vestrahorn towers above a lagoon and black sand beach in southeast Iceland. This mountain sits adjacent to Brunnhorn, which locals refer as the "Batman Mountain" because of the shape formed by its three peaks. The Stokksnes peninsula is popular with tourists and photographers, so expect to pay a small entrance fee on your way to get the most stunning views. If you time your visit just right, you may even get lucky enough to see the northern lights dance above Vestrahorn.</p>

            <h3>Ha Long Bay: Vietnam</h3>
            <img src="https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000162-f3a3-d0d5-a57f-fbf350f30000/6-halong-bay-vietnam.jpg?update-time=1677093986651&size=responsive970" alt="Ha Long Bay in Vietnam" width="400px">
            <p class="description">While many agree the more than 1,600 monsoon-eroded islands of Ha Long Bay (or Halong Bay) are beautiful and deserving of a place on UNESCO's World Heritage List, overtourism has taken its toll on the area. The best way to view the area's upright karst formations is on a licensed cruise, ideally from an ethical operator that prioritizes sustainability measures such as responsible waste disposal and employs local staff. One top option is Bhaya Cruises, whose excursions give you time to explore the bay and experience enriching cultural activities.</p>

            <h3>Santorini Caldera: Greece</h3>
            <img src="https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000162-f3a3-d0d5-a57f-fbf3a7160000/19-santorini-caldera.jpg?update-time=1677094345690&size=responsive970" alt="Santorini Caldera in Greece" width="400px">
            <p class="description">Cliff-hanging, whitewashed villas set against the brilliant Aegean Sea backdrop make Santorini one of Greece's most popular islands. But a truly special feature of this island is its caldera – a mostly submerged crater formed by a volcanic eruption around 1600 BC that covers a large part of the island. Spend sunset in Oia at the legendary ruins of the Agios Nikolaos castle to admire breathtaking views of the caldera and neighboring volcanic islands.</p>
