            <h2>Entry 1: Introduction to Web Design & Development</h2>
            <p>Today, I began my journey as a web developer. I learnt what web development is all about and what a webpage contains. I learnt that HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is used to make the skeleton or structure of a webpage, while CSS is used to make details the skin of the webpage, and javascript is used to give the webpage functionality and give it life to make it responsive</p>
            <p>I also learnt that web development consists of different process like the design and the development process. In the design process we take an idea of what we want our webpage to look like and fine tune it till we have a satisfactory template. Then we start development which is when we use th programming languages to let our idea come to life.</p>

            <h2>Entry 2: Introduction to Design</h2>
            <p>In my second step as a web developer, I explored design. And i learnt that design plays a crucial part in how we interact with products, services, and experiences. From the layout of a website to the aesthetics of a mobile app, design plays a crucial role in capturing attention, enhancing usability, and creating delightful user experiences. and i also learnt that design contains two important aspects; User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).</p>

            <h2>Entry 4: Javascript Basics</h2>
            <p>In the fourth step of my learning journey i learnt about javscript. Javascript is a programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to add funtionalities and interactivity to websites. By using javascript i am able to add things like dropdowns, form validation, hamburger menus, etc. to my website.</p>
